# Challenge 10

## SVG Logo Maker

In this challenge I have created a SVG logo generator that will prompt the user questions that will then create the logo. As the user inputs data we generate that information and validate the color and number of character entered for the text.

The screen recording shows all the prompts and how to initialize the program. To shorten video length i prefilled the data and started screen recording from the last point.
